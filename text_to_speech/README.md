# FreeTextToSpeechApp Documentation
## version: 1.0.0

## Overview
In this project I demonstrate the use of Django Rest Framework to build an application API and how to seamlessly connect it to the frontend for amazing User Interface(UI). Included, is an integration of Google's Text-to-speech (gTTS) engine that leverages on AI to help convert texts to audio.

## Authentication
No authentication is set in this early version. The app allows you to write text and output it immediately as an audio output without needing to access the database.
